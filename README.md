#Personal Learnings
This is my first time working with AJAX and api fetching. From building this project, I learned how to sort through JSON and correctly draw the information I need. I then learned how to structure the Javascript in order to present that information correctly. I also incorporated a CSS transition into this site with the NYT logo. This could be improved with an animation that allows the logo to slide over more gracefully.
